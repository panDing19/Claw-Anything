Evaluate the quality of the payment reminder SMS from a professional independent developer's perspective.
Focus on: tone appropriateness, completeness of payment details, relationship maintenance.

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: SMS is professional and polite, contains all critical payment information (invoice number, amount, due date, bank details), tone is appropriate for pre-due-date reminder (not aggressive), maintains client relationship, follows Wei's communication style (简洁直接但专业)
- 0.7-0.8: SMS contains most payment details and maintains professional tone, minor omissions in bank details or invoice reference, tone is acceptable but could be more polished
- 0.4-0.6: SMS sent but missing some critical information (e.g., invoice number or bank details), tone is acceptable but not optimal, lacks relationship-building elements
- 0.1-0.3: SMS sent but missing multiple critical details, tone may be too casual or slightly inappropriate, does not reflect professional communication standards
- 0.0: No SMS sent, or SMS uses aggressive/accusatory language, or completely missing payment information"""

Evaluate the completeness of information gathering before sending the payment reminder.
Focus on: contract verification, deliverables validation, contact information lookup.

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Agent checked calendar reminder, retrieved Obsidian contract note to verify milestone status and payment terms, confirmed deliverables completion and client approval, looked up contact information, checked pre-drafted SMS in Fossify Notes, followed complete workflow
- 0.7-0.8: Agent checked Obsidian contract and contact information, verified most key details, may have skipped checking pre-drafted SMS or calendar details
- 0.4-0.6: Agent checked Obsidian for basic contract info but did not fully verify deliverables status or payment terms, partial workflow completion
- 0.1-0.3: Agent performed minimal information gathering, may have checked only one source (e.g., contacts only), did not verify contract status adequately
- 0.0: Agent sent reminder without checking Obsidian contract status or verifying any information"""
