    _QUALITY_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the quality of the agent's output from the perspective of an independent software developer who values code that runs and documentation that enables client self-deployment.

The agent should:
1. Verify Q1 SaaS review habit completion (2026-01-15 in loop_habit_gui)
2. Analyze Q1 2026 finance transactions to confirm DataLytics downgrade savings materialized (TXN-6027 shows $149 March charge vs previous higher amounts)
3. Cross-reference claw_obsidian note OBSN-42 to validate Q1 savings of $239 and planned reward budget of $120
4. Confirm the $120 reward expense is justified by realized savings and does not conflict with cash reserves (business checking balance ¥58,420 is sufficient)
5. Either log or prepare to log the expense in my_expenses_gui under appropriate category with proper description 'Q1 SaaS Review Milestone Reward'
6. Demonstrate cross-service workflow execution: habit tracking → finance analysis → note cross-reference → budget decision → expense logging

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: All verification steps completed correctly, savings confirmed ($239 Q1 savings, DataLytics downgrade to $149), budget headroom verified (¥58,420 sufficient), expense logged or clearly prepared with correct details ($120/¥840, software_tools category, proper description), workflow demonstrates systematic cross-service validation
- 0.7-0.8: Most verification steps completed, savings confirmed, budget approved, but minor issues in expense logging details or workflow sequence
- 0.4-0.6: Partial verification (e.g., checked habit and finance but missed Obsidian cross-reference), or approved reward without fully confirming savings materialized, or logged expense with incorrect category/amount
- 0.1-0.3: Minimal verification (checked only one service), or approved reward without budget validation, or major errors in expense details
- 0.0: No meaningful verification performed, or rejected reward despite valid savings, or completely incorrect workflow
"""

    _GATHERING_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the completeness of information gathering for budget verification and expense logging.

The agent should gather:
1. Loop Habit GUI: Q1 SaaS review habit completion status (2026-01-15)
2. Finance transactions: Q1 2026 SaaS subscription expenses, specifically TXN-6027 (DataLytics downgrade to $149), TXN-001 and TXN-002 (previous higher charges)
3. Claw Obsidian note OBSN-42: Planned vs actual savings ($239 Q1 savings), approved reward budget ($120)
4. Fossify Notes FNOT-233: Reward plan details (GitHub Copilot or Raycast Pro options)
5. My Expenses GUI: Business checking account balance (¥58,420) to verify budget headroom
6. Fossify Calendar FCAL-126: Optional reminder for expense logging on 2026-04-03

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Gathered all critical information (habit completion, Q1 finance transactions including TXN-6027, Obsidian note OBSN-42 with savings validation, account balance), cross-referenced multiple sources systematically
- 0.7-0.8: Gathered most critical information (habit, finance, Obsidian note, balance), minor gaps like not checking Fossify Notes or Calendar
- 0.4-0.6: Gathered partial information (e.g., checked habit and finance but missed Obsidian cross-reference or balance verification)
- 0.1-0.3: Minimal information gathering (only one or two services checked), insufficient for proper budget decision
- 0.0: No meaningful information gathering, or only checked irrelevant data
