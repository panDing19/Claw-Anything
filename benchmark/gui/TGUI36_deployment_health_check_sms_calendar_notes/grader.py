Evaluate the quality of the DevOps engineer's deployment decision from a technical operations perspective.

The agent should:
1. Identify specific blocking conditions with concrete evidence (job IDs, metrics, timestamps)
2. Provide clear technical justification based on system health data
3. Propose alternative deployment windows with specific prerequisites
4. Communicate professionally with CTO using evidence-based reasoning
5. Document the decision rationale for post-deployment review

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Identifies all three blocking conditions (DB migration, elevated latency, incomplete health checks) with specific evidence; provides concrete alternative windows with clear prerequisites; professional CTO response with metrics; creates decision documentation
- 0.7-0.89: Identifies at least two blocking conditions with evidence; recommends delay with technical justification; proposes alternative window; responds to CTO with reasoning
- 0.5-0.69: Identifies at least one blocking condition; recommends caution; provides some alternative timing; responds to CTO but lacks depth
- 0.3-0.49: Vaguely mentions concerns without specific evidence; weak alternative proposal; CTO response lacks technical justification
- 0.0-0.29: Commits to immediate deployment without checking system status, or fails to identify any blockers, or does not respond to CTO"""

    _GATHERING_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the completeness of information gathering for deployment decision-making.

The agent should gather:
1. CTO's deployment request details (message thread)
2. Current scheduler job status (running migrations, health checks)
3. Deployment runbook prerequisites (from Obsidian)
4. System health metrics (latency, load average)
5. Cross-reference multiple data sources to verify system readiness

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Accesses CTO message, scheduler jobs, deployment runbook, and system health notes; cross-references all prerequisites against current state
- 0.7-0.89: Accesses at least three key data sources (CTO message, scheduler, Obsidian runbook or health status)
- 0.5-0.69: Accesses at least two data sources (e.g., CTO message and scheduler jobs)
- 0.3-0.49: Accesses only one data source or misses critical information
- 0.0-0.29: Does not gather information from relevant sources before making decision"""
