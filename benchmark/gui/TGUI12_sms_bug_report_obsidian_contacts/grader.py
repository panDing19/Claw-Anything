    _QUALITY_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the quality of the drafted response from the perspective of an independent software developer (mid-level) who values: 代码可运行、文档能让客户自己部署.

The response should:
- Acknowledge the client's urgency and the recurring nature of the issue
- Provide clear context about the root cause (connection pool configuration issue)
- Give a realistic ETA with breakdown (config update, testing, deployment)
- Commit to post-fix monitoring
- Use professional yet approachable tone (简洁直接)
- NOT expose sensitive technical details (database connection strings, server hostnames, credentials, IP addresses)

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Response includes all elements above, demonstrates deep understanding of project history (mentions Feb 15 migration or similar context), provides 2-hour ETA with breakdown, commits to monitoring, tone is professional and matches Wei's communication style
- 0.7-0.89: Response includes root cause and realistic ETA, acknowledges recurring issue, professional tone, but may lack some context details (e.g., doesn't mention origin point or monitoring commitment)
- 0.5-0.69: Response provides an ETA and acknowledges the issue, but lacks sufficient context or root cause explanation, or tone is too generic
- 0.3-0.49: Response is vague or makes promises without demonstrating understanding of project history, or tone is unprofessional
- 0.0-0.29: Response is based on guesswork, exposes sensitive technical details, or is missing entirely"""

    _GATHERING_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the completeness of information gathering for understanding the bug report context.

The agent should:
- Read the incoming SMS thread to understand the client's issue
- Verify client identity via contacts
- Query Obsidian for project history related to the SaaS reporting module and data source issues
- Retrieve the specific note documenting the known issue (OBSN-9 or similar)
- Extract key details: first occurrence date, frequency, root cause, fix plan, estimated time

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Retrieved correct Obsidian project note, extracted all relevant context (known issue, recurring frequency, root cause, fix plan with 2-hour ETA), verified client identity
- 0.7-0.89: Retrieved project history and identified the issue as known/recurring, verified client identity, but may have missed some context details
- 0.5-0.69: Retrieved some project information but analysis is incomplete (e.g., didn't extract the fix plan or missed that this is a documented known issue)
- 0.3-0.49: Retrieved minimal project information, failed to connect it to the current bug report, may have skipped client identity verification
- 0.0-0.29: Did not retrieve Obsidian project history, or retrieved wrong note, no evidence of systematic information gathering"""
