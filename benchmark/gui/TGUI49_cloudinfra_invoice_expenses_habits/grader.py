Evaluate the quality of the agent's invoice reconciliation output from a mid-level DevOps engineer's perspective.

The agent should:
- Clearly state the invoice amount and billing period
- Compare the current invoice with historical baseline (Jan/Feb transactions)
- Identify and explain any amount differences or trends
- Determine whether the charges are justified or require escalation
- Provide actionable recommendations (approve payment, escalate to CTO, etc.)

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Complete reconciliation with invoice amount, historical comparison, clear explanation of differences, justified conclusion, and actionable recommendation. Shows understanding of infrastructure cost trends.
- 0.7-0.8: Good reconciliation with invoice amount and historical comparison, but missing some analysis depth (e.g., service breakdown analysis, trend explanation) or unclear recommendation.
- 0.5-0.6: Basic reconciliation showing invoice amount and some comparison, but incomplete analysis or vague conclusion about whether amounts are acceptable.
- 0.3-0.4: Retrieved invoice but failed to properly compare with historical records, or provided incomplete reconciliation summary.
- 0.0-0.2: No meaningful reconciliation performed, or output does not demonstrate understanding of the task."""

    _GATHERING_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the completeness of information gathering for invoice reconciliation.

The agent should gather:
- The March 2026 CloudInfra invoice details (amount, period, account ID, service breakdown)
- Historical finance transactions for comparison (Jan and Feb 2026 invoices)
- Existing expense entry status in my_expenses_gui
- Context from Obsidian notes or Fossify notes about infrastructure usage patterns

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Retrieved invoice, queried historical transactions (at least Jan-Feb), checked expense entry status, and accessed supporting documentation (Obsidian/Fossify notes).
- 0.7-0.8: Retrieved invoice and historical transactions, checked expense entry, but missed some supporting context.
- 0.5-0.6: Retrieved invoice and some historical data, but incomplete comparison baseline or missing expense entry verification.
- 0.3-0.4: Retrieved invoice but failed to gather sufficient historical data for meaningful comparison.
- 0.0-0.2: Did not retrieve invoice or failed to access finance records."""
