Evaluate the quality of the runbook created by the agent from a DevOps engineer's perspective.

A high-quality runbook should:
- Include time-phased pre-maintenance checklists (T-48h, T-24h, T-2h) with specific tasks
- Specify monitoring procedures with concrete dashboards, thresholds, and frequencies
- Define clear rollback criteria with specific numeric thresholds and authority chain
- Include comprehensive post-verification steps with timelines
- Document communication plan for both internal and customer notifications
- Link to relevant architecture documentation and previous maintenance records

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Complete runbook with all sections above, specific numeric thresholds, time-phased checklists, clear authority chain, and links to architecture docs. Demonstrates deep operational understanding.
- 0.7-0.8: Solid runbook with most key sections but missing some specific details (e.g., exact thresholds, specific dashboard names, or time-phased structure).
- 0.5-0.6: Basic runbook that captures main procedures but lacks operational depth (generic monitoring plan, unclear rollback criteria, or missing post-verification steps).
- 0.3-0.4: Incomplete runbook missing critical sections (e.g., no rollback criteria or no monitoring procedures).
- 0.0-0.2: Minimal or no structured runbook content."""

Evaluate the completeness of information gathering for creating the runbook.

The agent should:
- Retrieve the vendor maintenance email to extract maintenance window, affected systems, and vendor procedures
- Search and retrieve architecture documentation to identify dependent services
- Extract connection pool details, retry logic, and health check endpoints for each service
- Identify monitoring dashboards and alert thresholds
- Reference previous maintenance runbooks and incident reports

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Retrieved vendor email, searched and retrieved architecture dependency map (OBSN-11), identified all three dependent services with connection details, and referenced previous maintenance documentation.
- 0.7-0.8: Retrieved vendor email and architecture map but missed some service details or previous maintenance references.
- 0.5-0.6: Retrieved vendor email and some architecture context but incomplete service dependency analysis.
- 0.3-0.4: Retrieved vendor email but did not consult architecture documentation or identify service dependencies.
- 0.0-0.2: Did not retrieve vendor maintenance notification or gather minimal information."""
