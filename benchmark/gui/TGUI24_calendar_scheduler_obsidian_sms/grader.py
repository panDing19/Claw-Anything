Evaluate the quality of the agent's final output from the perspective of an independent software developer who values "code that runs, documentation that lets clients deploy themselves."

Key criteria:
- Does the agent correctly identify the root cause (DataLytics API tier downgrade from Professional to Basic on March 30)?
- Does the agent propose a working fix (upgrade DataLytics tier immediately)?
- Does the agent draft a clear client message explaining the issue, resolution, and timeline?
- Does the agent offer Li Qiang the choice to proceed with or reschedule the 16:00 call?
- Does the agent recognize the SLA breach severity (48 hours downtime exceeds 7-hour monthly allowance)?

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Correctly identifies root cause, proposes immediate tier upgrade, drafts clear proactive message with all key elements (root cause, resolution, timeline, call choice), recognizes SLA breach
- 0.7-0.8: Identifies root cause and proposes fix, drafts message but missing one key element (e.g., doesn't offer call choice or doesn't mention SLA breach)
- 0.4-0.6: Identifies the job failure and some root cause details, but proposes incomplete fix or drafts vague message
- 0.1-0.3: Notices the job failure but doesn't identify root cause or proposes wrong fix
- 0.0: Doesn't identify the job failure or proposes harmful action (e.g., deleting the job)"""

Evaluate the completeness of information gathering for diagnosing a failed SaaS report job before a client call.

Key information sources:
- Scheduler job status and execution history (JOB-714)
- Integration config status (INT-108 DataLytics)
- Client contact notes and expectations (OBSN-45)
- Root cause analysis notes (OBSN-46)
- Client communication history (WeChat messages)
- Calendar event details (FCAL-128)

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Accesses scheduler job details, integration config, client contact notes, and root cause analysis notes; cross-references multiple sources to understand the full context
- 0.7-0.8: Accesses scheduler and integration config, plus at least one Obsidian note; understands most of the context
- 0.4-0.6: Accesses scheduler job details and integration config but doesn't check client notes or communication history
- 0.1-0.3: Only checks scheduler or calendar without investigating root cause
- 0.0: Doesn't gather any relevant information"""
