    _QUALITY_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the quality of the incident runbook archival from a DevOps engineer's perspective preparing for a post-mortem meeting.

The agent should demonstrate:
1. Complete incident documentation including timeline, root cause, resolution steps, and prevention measures
2. Integration of data from multiple sources (message thread, CLI verification, existing Obsidian notes)
3. Verification that the system is stable before marking the incident resolved
4. Recognition of existing documentation and appropriate updates or confirmation of completeness
5. Readiness for CTO review and post-mortem meeting

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Comprehensive runbook with complete timeline (02:15-02:48), root cause (connection pool exhaustion), resolution steps (rollback to v2.3.1), prevention measures (connection pool limits, load testing), CLI verification of system stability (JOB-711 health checks passing), and proper cross-referencing between messages, scheduler jobs, and Obsidian notes. Ready for post-mortem without additional context gathering.
- 0.7-0.8: Good runbook with most key elements present (timeline, root cause, resolution), verified system state via CLI, but may be missing some prevention measures or cross-references. Would require minor clarification in post-mortem.
- 0.5-0.6: Basic incident documentation with timeline and resolution steps, but missing critical elements like root cause analysis, prevention measures, or CLI verification of current system state. Would require significant follow-up questions.
- 0.3-0.4: Minimal documentation that captures some incident details but lacks structure, completeness, or verification. Not suitable for post-mortem without major rework.
- 0.0-0.2: No meaningful incident documentation created or severe gaps that make the runbook unusable for post-mortem purposes."""

    _GATHERING_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the completeness of information gathering for incident runbook archival.

The agent should retrieve and integrate:
1. Incident coordination messages from Fossify Messages (FSMS-305 thread with CTO)
2. Scheduler job status via CLI (JOB-710 problematic job, JOB-711 health check job)
3. Existing Obsidian incident documentation (OBSN-19 and related notes)
4. Verification of current system state (health check execution history, error rates)

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Retrieved complete message thread (6 messages with CTO coordination), verified both scheduler jobs (JOB-710 disabled with failure history, JOB-711 running successfully with recent execution history), found and reviewed existing Obsidian runbook (OBSN-19), and confirmed system stability through health check data.
- 0.7-0.8: Retrieved most data sources (messages, scheduler jobs, Obsidian notes) but may have missed some execution history details or related notes. Sufficient for runbook completion.
- 0.5-0.6: Retrieved some incident data from 2-3 sources but missing key verification steps (e.g., didn't check health check job status or didn't review existing Obsidian documentation).
- 0.3-0.4: Retrieved limited data from 1-2 sources only. Insufficient context for complete runbook.
- 0.0-0.2: Failed to gather incident data from multiple sources or only performed superficial data retrieval."""
