    _QUALITY_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the quality of the product manager's strategic analysis and communication with the design lead.

The agent should:
1. Clearly identify the specific inconsistency between the PRD and Q1 OKR strategy
2. Articulate the conflict: PRD focuses on acquisition (social sharing for viral growth) vs OKR focuses on retention (Day-7 retention, repeat purchase, churn reduction)
3. Reference the authoritative OKR document (OBSN-10 'Q1 2026 Growth Strategy & OKR Tracking')
4. Explain the business impact: feature won't move Q1 KPIs and consumes sprint capacity on off-strategy work
5. Provide actionable guidance: suggest reframing as retention tool or deferring to Q2
6. Communicate urgency: PRD revision needed before April 3rd review meeting

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Identifies the acquisition vs retention conflict precisely, references OBSN-10 with specific details (Q1 KPI targets, social/viral deferred to Q2), explains business impact clearly, provides concrete revision suggestions, and communicates urgency appropriately
- 0.7-0.8: Identifies the strategic misalignment and references the OKR document, explains impact, provides revision direction, but may lack some specificity in KPI details or suggested actions
- 0.5-0.6: Recognizes there is a conflict and attempts to reference strategy documents, but analysis is vague or incomplete; may miss key details about Q1 priorities or fail to provide clear revision guidance
- 0.3-0.4: Notices something is off but fails to clearly articulate the strategic conflict or provide meaningful guidance; may not reference the OKR document properly
- 0.0-0.2: Does not identify the strategic inconsistency or provides irrelevant analysis; fails to demonstrate product management judgment"""

    _GATHERING_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the completeness and relevance of information gathering for strategic alignment verification.

The agent should:
1. Locate and retrieve the social sharing PRD draft from Obsidian
2. Identify the PRD's strategic positioning (acquisition-focused social sharing)
3. Locate and retrieve the Q1 2026 OKR/strategy document (OBSN-10)
4. Extract key strategic priorities: retention focus, specific KPI targets (Day-7 retention 25%, repeat purchase 40%), target segment (existing users)
5. Identify that social/viral features are explicitly out of scope for Q1 and deferred to Q2
6. Locate the design lead contact information (Li Jing, thread FSMS-303 or +86 13698745210)

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Retrieves both PRD and OKR documents, extracts all key strategic details (retention focus, specific KPIs, Q2 deferral), locates design lead contact, demonstrates thorough cross-referencing
- 0.7-0.8: Retrieves core documents and extracts main strategic priorities, locates design lead, but may miss some specific KPI details or rationale
- 0.5-0.6: Retrieves at least one key document (PRD or OKR) and attempts to find relevant information, but gathering is incomplete or misses critical details
- 0.3-0.4: Attempts to search for documents but fails to retrieve key information or does not cross-reference properly
- 0.0-0.2: Does not gather relevant strategic documents or contact information; shows no systematic information gathering"""
