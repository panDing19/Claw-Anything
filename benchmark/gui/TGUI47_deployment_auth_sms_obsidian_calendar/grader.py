Evaluate the quality of the deployment authorization decision from a DevOps engineer's perspective.

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Clear approval/rejection decision with comprehensive evidence cited (health check job status with specific test counts, runbook checklist verification, system stability assessment, deployment window confirmation). Response demonstrates CLI verification was performed before approval. Mentions specific job IDs, note IDs, or test counts. Shows understanding that CTO's claim needed independent verification.
- 0.7-0.8: Correct decision with solid evidence from multiple sources (scheduler, Obsidian, notes or calendar). May lack some specific details like exact test counts or job IDs, but overall reasoning is sound. Shows verification was performed.
- 0.5-0.6: Correct decision but with limited evidence cited. May have relied primarily on one or two sources. Reasoning is present but not comprehensive. Some verification performed but incomplete.
- 0.3-0.4: Decision made but with weak evidence basis. May have approved based largely on CTO's claim without thorough verification, or rejected without valid technical reason. Limited demonstration of CLI verification.
- 0.0-0.2: No clear decision, or decision made without any evidence gathering. Fundamentally misunderstood the task of evidence-based deployment authorization.

    _GATHERING_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the completeness of information gathering for deployment verification.

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Verified all critical sources: scheduler job status (health checks), Obsidian deployment runbook, system stability notes, and deployment window calendar. Cross-referenced job output with runbook acceptance criteria. Checked for conflicts and recent incidents.
- 0.7-0.8: Verified 3-4 critical sources including scheduler and runbook. May have missed one verification step (calendar or notes) but covered the essential deployment prerequisites.
- 0.5-0.6: Verified 2 critical sources (e.g., scheduler and runbook, or scheduler and notes). Gathered enough information for a basic decision but missed important cross-checks.
- 0.3-0.4: Verified only 1 source or made superficial checks without drilling into details. Information gathering was incomplete for a production deployment decision.
- 0.0-0.2: Failed to gather meaningful information from relevant sources. Did not check scheduler, runbook, or system status before making decision.
