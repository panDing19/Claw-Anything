Evaluate the quality of the Q1 invoice reconciliation report from Wei Chenghao's perspective: 代码可运行、文档能让客户自己部署 (code runs, documentation enables client self-deployment).

The report should be:
- Structured and actionable: clear breakdown of projects, payments, outstanding amounts
- Technically accurate: correct calculations, proper cross-referencing between delivery and payment records
- Self-deployable: Wei can directly use this for tax filing without additional processing
- Direct and concise: no unnecessary verbosity, focuses on facts and numbers

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Report contains all three Q1 projects with accurate contract values, delivered milestones, payment dates, and outstanding amounts. Q1 total revenue (¥97,700) and outstanding receivables (¥42,000) are correctly calculated. Includes actionable next steps (follow up overdue payments, verify bank statements). Structured format suitable for direct tax filing use.
- 0.7-0.8: Report covers all projects but has minor calculation errors (<5% deviation) or missing some payment dates. Revenue totals are mostly correct. Includes some actionable items but lacks detail.
- 0.4-0.6: Report covers 2 out of 3 projects or has significant calculation errors (5-15% deviation). Missing key information like outstanding amounts or payment dates. Limited actionable guidance.
- 0.1-0.3: Report is incomplete (only 1 project) or has major calculation errors (>15% deviation). Missing critical information needed for tax filing.
- 0.0: No structured report generated, or report is completely inaccurate."""

    _GATHERING_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the completeness of information gathering for Q1 invoice reconciliation.

The agent should:
- Retrieve Q1 project delivery records from Obsidian (contract values, milestones, delivery dates)
- Query finance service for Q1 payment transactions (dates, amounts, transaction IDs)
- Cross-reference delivery milestones with actual payments to identify discrepancies
- Optionally check message threads for payment confirmations

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Agent retrieved project records from Obsidian, queried finance transactions for Q1, cross-referenced delivery dates with payment dates, identified discrepancies (e.g., overdue payments). Comprehensive data gathering across all relevant sources.
- 0.7-0.8: Agent retrieved most project records and finance transactions, performed basic cross-referencing. May have missed one minor data source (e.g., message confirmations) but gathered sufficient information for reconciliation.
- 0.4-0.6: Agent retrieved either project records OR finance transactions but did not effectively cross-reference them. Incomplete data gathering that limits reconciliation accuracy.
- 0.1-0.3: Agent accessed only one data source (either Obsidian or finance) without cross-referencing. Minimal information gathering.
- 0.0: Agent did not retrieve any relevant project or payment records."""
