Evaluate the quality of the agent's decision recommendation from the perspective of an independent software developer who values code reliability and cost-effectiveness.

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Provides a clear, actionable decision (negotiate/migrate/renew) with comprehensive justification including: (1) price increase impact with historical comparison, (2) usage efficiency analysis showing quota utilization, (3) service quality assessment with evidence, (4) ROI calculation at both old and new price points, (5) alternative provider trade-offs with migration cost analysis, (6) deadline awareness. Reasoning demonstrates pragmatic cost-benefit thinking aligned with maintaining client service stability while optimizing margins.
- 0.7-0.89: Makes a clear decision with solid justification covering most key factors (price impact, ROI, alternatives), but may miss one dimension (e.g., service quality trends or migration cost analysis). Shows cost-effectiveness awareness but reasoning is less comprehensive.
- 0.5-0.69: Provides a decision with partial justification. May calculate price increase and ROI but miss critical trade-offs like usage efficiency or service degradation. Reasoning is present but incomplete.
- 0.3-0.49: Makes a recommendation but with weak justification. May identify the price increase but fail to analyze whether it's justified given usage patterns and service quality. Missing key cost-benefit analysis.
- 0.0-0.29: No clear decision provided, or decision made without any supporting analysis. Does not demonstrate understanding of the cost-benefit trade-offs involved in the renewal decision."""

Evaluate the completeness of information gathering for making an informed SaaS renewal decision.

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Retrieved renewal email with full pricing details, cross-referenced historical billing records from finance CLI, consulted Obsidian cost-tracking notes for usage metrics and ROI analysis, checked scheduler/config for service quality metrics (error rates, degradation status). Gathered all necessary data to assess price justification, usage efficiency, and service quality trends.
- 0.7-0.89: Retrieved email and at least two additional data sources (finance records + either Obsidian notes OR scheduler metrics). Gathered enough data for a reasonable decision but may have missed one dimension (e.g., service quality monitoring or alternative provider research).
- 0.5-0.69: Retrieved email and one additional data source (finance OR Obsidian). Has basic pricing information but incomplete picture of usage efficiency or service quality.
- 0.3-0.49: Retrieved renewal email but failed to cross-reference with historical data or usage metrics. Information gathering is superficial.
- 0.0-0.29: Did not retrieve the renewal email or failed to gather any supporting data for the decision."""
