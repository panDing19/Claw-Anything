Evaluate the quality of the handover reports from an independent developer's perspective (代码可运行、文档能让客户自己部署).

The agent should produce three separate handover reports (one per Q1 project) that:
- Present technical delivery status in client-friendly language (not raw CLI jargon)
- Summarize client communication patterns (催促 frequency, feedback timing, response delays)
- Clearly state payment status and outstanding invoices
- Flag discrepancies between technical completion and client perception
- Include actionable next steps (e.g., clarification calls, payment requests)

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Three complete, well-structured reports with clear technical status, communication summary, payment status, and discrepancy analysis. Language is client-friendly and actionable.
- 0.7-0.8: Three reports present with most key sections, but may lack depth in discrepancy analysis or next steps. Language mostly client-friendly.
- 0.5-0.6: Reports exist but are incomplete (missing payment status or communication summary) or mix technical jargon without translation.
- 0.3-0.4: Only partial reports (1-2 projects) or reports missing critical sections (e.g., no payment status).
- 0.0-0.2: No structured reports or reports are incoherent/unusable."""

    _GATHERING_RUBRIC = """\
Evaluate the completeness of information gathering across CLI logs, mobile communications, and finance data.

The agent should:
- Extract technical metrics from Obsidian project notes (completion status, requirement changes, time expenditure)
- Review scheduler job history for deployment milestones and failures
- Check SMS and WeChat threads for client feedback, 催促 messages, and requirement changes
- Verify payment status from finance transactions (milestones paid, outstanding invoices)
- Correlate data across sources to identify patterns (e.g., high requirement change rate vs client confusion)

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Accessed all four data sources (Obsidian, scheduler, mobile comms, finance) and correlated findings across sources for all three projects.
- 0.7-0.8: Accessed 3-4 data sources with good coverage, minor gaps in correlation or one project less thoroughly researched.
- 0.5-0.6: Accessed 2-3 data sources but missing key information (e.g., no payment check or no scheduler history).
- 0.3-0.4: Only accessed 1-2 data sources, significant gaps in information gathering.
- 0.0-0.2: Minimal or no information gathering from relevant sources."""
