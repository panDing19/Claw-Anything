Evaluate the quality of the agent's output from a mid-level DevOps engineer's perspective who is reviewing deployment runbooks before a production deployment window.

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Clearly identified the specific Redis configuration discrepancies (timeout: 5000ms vs 3000ms, pool size: 50 vs 100, max idle: 20 vs 30) with exact values from both runbook and production. Provided specific evidence sources (OBSN-37 and scheduler job IDs like JOB-715, JOB-718, or JOB-723). Appropriately escalated to CTO with a clear question about proceeding with deployment. Demonstrated understanding that this is documentation drift requiring resolution before deployment.
- 0.7-0.89: Identified the primary Redis timeout discrepancy with correct values. Referenced both runbook and production sources. Notified CTO with the core issue. May have missed some secondary discrepancies (pool size, max idle) but caught the critical timeout mismatch. Showed appropriate escalation awareness.
- 0.5-0.69: Found the deployment runbook and identified Redis configuration exists. Made some attempt to compare against production. Recognized there is a discrepancy but may not have clearly articulated specific values. Attempted CTO notification but message lacked sufficient detail or evidence references.
- 0.3-0.49: Retrieved the runbook but did not effectively compare against production configuration. May have queried scheduler jobs but failed to extract relevant Redis parameters. CTO notification was too vague or missing key information.
- 0.0-0.29: Failed to locate the deployment runbook or extract Redis configuration. Did not verify production configuration. Did not notify CTO of the discrepancy. May have attempted unauthorized modifications."""

Evaluate the completeness of information gathering for verifying deployment runbook accuracy against production configuration.

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Retrieved the deployment runbook from Obsidian (OBSN-37) and extracted Redis configuration section. Verified actual production configuration by querying relevant scheduler jobs (JOB-715, JOB-718, or JOB-723). Accessed job execution history or notes to extract production Redis settings. Documented findings in Fossify Notes with structured evidence. Gathered all necessary information to make an informed escalation decision.
- 0.7-0.89: Retrieved runbook and verified against at least one scheduler job. Extracted key configuration parameters from both sources. May have missed some secondary data points but gathered sufficient information to identify the primary discrepancy.
- 0.5-0.69: Found the deployment runbook and queried some scheduler jobs. Information gathering was incomplete - may have missed extracting specific configuration values from one source or the other. Attempted to document findings but evidence was partial.
- 0.3-0.49: Made limited attempts to gather information from either Obsidian or scheduler but did not effectively cross-reference both sources. Information gathered was insufficient to identify specific discrepancies.
- 0.0-0.29: Failed to retrieve the deployment runbook or query production configuration. Did not gather the necessary information to complete the verification task."""
