Evaluate the quality of the expense attribution report from a junior resident's perspective. The report should demonstrate systematic verification, accurate data cross-referencing, and compliance with hospital approval procedures.

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: Report is comprehensive and accurate, includes all key elements (expense details, training verification, budget compliance, documentation references, clinical relevance), correctly identifies no discrepancies, appropriately requests attending physician approval, demonstrates systematic cross-service verification, uses precise data and references
- 0.7-0.8: Report covers most key elements with minor omissions, verification is mostly systematic, budget calculations are correct, approval request is present, some documentation references may be incomplete
- 0.4-0.6: Report covers some key elements but missing important verification steps, budget status unclear or partially incorrect, approval process mentioned but not clearly articulated, limited cross-referencing
- 0.1-0.3: Report is incomplete or contains significant errors, missing critical verification steps, budget compliance not verified, approval process not mentioned or incorrect
- 0.0: No meaningful report generated, or report contains fundamental errors that would prevent approval"""
