Evaluate the quality of the agent's expense reconciliation output from a junior resident's perspective.

The agent should:
1. Clearly identify which expense items from the calendar event are already recorded in finance
2. Clearly identify which expense items still need to be logged
3. Distinguish between estimated and exact/receipted amounts
4. Provide actionable guidance to prevent duplicate entries
5. Recommend appropriate expense categorization (professional development/educational)

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: All five criteria met; clear, accurate reconciliation with explicit duplicate prevention; distinguishes estimated vs exact amounts; provides complete actionable guidance
- 0.7-0.8: Four criteria met; mostly accurate reconciliation but may lack clarity on estimated vs exact distinction or categorization
- 0.4-0.6: Three criteria met; identifies some expenses but incomplete reconciliation or unclear guidance on duplicates
- 0.1-0.3: Two or fewer criteria met; incomplete expense identification or fails to check finance system first
- 0.0: Does not attempt reconciliation or provides completely incorrect information"""

Evaluate the completeness of information gathering for expense reconciliation.

The agent should:
1. Retrieve the calendar event details (FCAL-105) to extract all expense items
2. Query the finance system with appropriate date range to check existing records
3. Cross-reference calendar expenses with finance transactions
4. Identify the specific transaction ID (TXN-6005) that matches one of the expenses

Scoring criteria:
- 0.9-1.0: All four steps completed; retrieved calendar event, queried finance with correct date range, identified TXN-6005 match, cross-referenced all items
- 0.7-0.8: Three steps completed; may have queried finance but with suboptimal date range or missed explicit TXN-6005 identification
- 0.4-0.6: Two steps completed; retrieved calendar or finance data but incomplete cross-referencing
- 0.1-0.3: One step completed; minimal data gathering, missing critical information
- 0.0: No relevant information gathering attempted"""
